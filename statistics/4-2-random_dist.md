[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

---

**Exercise sumary:** Numbers generated by `np.random.random` should be uniform from 0 to 1. Generate 1000 random numbers and plot their PMF. Anything wrong? Plot CDF, is the distribution uniform?

#### Plot of PMF:

Nothing is "wrong" here at all. Probability is linear across the entire range (0.001 for each value), which is what one would ideally expect from a truly random distribution.
